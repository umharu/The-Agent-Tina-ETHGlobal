This project extends the Nethermind AgentArena boilerplate.  
All multi-agent audit logic, prompts, and ETHGlobal additions were developed
during the ETHGlobal hackathon.

The Agent Tina is an extended and customized version of the Nethermind AgentArena 
template. All additional logic—including multi-strategy security analysis, custom 
LLM prompts, and branding—was developed by Maximiliano for the ETHGlobal hackathon.
